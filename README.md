Project: Simple To-Do List Web Application

Description:
The goal of this project is to create a simple web-based to-do list application that allows users to manage their tasks by adding, removing, and marking them as completed. The application will be built using HTML for the structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for functionality. It serves as a practical and educational project for web development beginners, providing hands-on experience in building a basic interactive web application.

Key Features:

User Interface:

The user interface includes a title, an input field to add new tasks, an "Add" button, and an unordered list to display tasks.
Adding Tasks:

Users can add new tasks by typing them into the input field and clicking the "Add" button. Tasks are displayed as list items in the unordered list.
Removing Tasks:

Each task is accompanied by a "Delete" button that allows users to remove tasks they no longer wish to keep on their to-do list.
Marking Tasks as Completed:

A checkbox is provided next to each task, enabling users to mark tasks as completed. Completed tasks can be visually distinguished, e.g., through strike-through text or other styling.
Validation (Optional):

Basic input validation can be implemented to prevent users from adding empty tasks.
Local Storage (Optional):

Optionally, the project can implement local storage to persist tasks even after refreshing the web page. This ensures that the to-do list remains intact across sessions.
Styling and CSS:

CSS is used to style the to-do list application, making it visually appealing and user-friendly.
Event Handling:

JavaScript is used to handle user interactions, such as adding tasks, removing tasks, and marking tasks as completed. Event listeners are used to capture user actions.
Learning Objectives:

Understand the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Learn how to create a simple web form for user input.
Gain experience in handling user interactions and events using JavaScript.
Apply CSS styling to create an attractive and responsive user interface.
Explore optional features like validation and local storage to enhance the functionality of the application.
Extensions and Further Development:

This basic to-do list application can serve as a foundation for more advanced projects. You can extend the functionality by adding features such as task prioritization, due dates, categories, user authentication, or the ability to edit existing tasks. Additionally, you can consider making the application responsive for mobile devices or even integrating it with a backend server for data persistence and user accounts
